CHANGE LOG : TRANSFORMMANAGER (AS3)
----------------------------------------
1.915:
	- TransformManager now dispatches START_INTERACTIVE_MOVE events when the arrowKeysMove is true and one of the arrow keys is pressed.
	- Fixed issue that could cause a selected TransformItem to dispatch a FINISH_INTERACTIVE_ROTATION event instead of a FINISH_INTERACTIVE_MOVE or FINISH_INTERACTIVE_SCALE event (the TransformManager still dispatched the correct event - it was only the TransformItem that didn't in some situations).
1.914:
	- Fixed issue that could cause TransformManager not to deselect properly when it is used in an swf that is subloaded and the subloaded swf's coordinates are offset from 0,0.
1.912:
	- Fixed issue in Flex that could cause the selection not to render correctly on certain types of objects when selected immediately after being created.
1.911:
	- Fixed issue in Flex that threw an error when adding an object and immediately selecting it with a method like selectItem()
	- Updated FlexTransformManager to recognize some of the spark components from Flex 4 as being text-related and automatically applying the SCALE_WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT scaleMode.
1.91:
	- Fixed issue that would cause a START interactive move/scale/rotate event to be dispatched but not a FINISH one when the mouse wasn't moved at all. Now the START/FINISH events only get dispatched when an interactive move/scale/rotate actually changes values.
1.9:
	- Added dispatching of START_INTERACTIVE_MOVE, START_INTERACTIVE_SCALE, and START_INTERACTIVE_ROTATE events from TransformManager
1.891:
	- Prevented the cursor from being stuck in the "move" state if an object was deleted while being dragged.
1.89:
	- Added SEIZE_CURSOR and RELEASE_CURSOR event dispatching from TransformManager.
	- Added isShowingCustomCursor property to TransformManager
1.888:
	- Added fitInsideBounds() method to TransformItem
	- Enforced bounds when TransformItem instances are created.
1.887:
	- Fixed Flex-related problem that could cause certain types of objects not to draw the bounds of selections properly.
1.886:
	- Fixed applyFullXML() and applyItemXML() so that TextFields get their width/height set properly.
1.885:
	- Fixed applyFullXML() and applyItemXML() so that if an item is already being managed by the TransformManager, it automatically calls update() on the TransformItem to ensure the position/rotation/scale data is updated.
1.884:
	- Altered FlexTransformManager so that bounds could be set before the object was added to the stage.
1.883:
	- Fixed potential problem that could occur in rare circumstances in Flex 4 regarding an error thrown when clicking before the TransformManager had been fully instantiated.
1.882:
	- Fixed issue with the way Flex instantiates children in FlexTransformManager which previously prevented selectedTargetObjects from being set initially. 
1.881:
	- Fixed bug that could cause an error if exportSettingsXML() was used when no bounds were defined.
1.88:
	- Added XML exporting/importing capabilities like exportFullXML() and applyFullXML()
1.874:
	- Fixed problem that could arise if the root's x/y coordinates are offset.
1.873:
	- Corrected documentation which incorrectly indicated that TranformManager dispatched SELECT events (it dispatches SELECTION_CHANGE events whereas TransformItem dispatches SELECT events)
	- Improved rendering refresh rate using updateAfterEvent()
1.871:
	- Fixed issue that could cause Keyboard events not to be received properly after calling destroy() on a TransformManager instance.
1.87:
	- Fixed bug that could cause odd scaling behavior in certain circumstances
	- Optimized the matrix scaling code for better performance
1.862:
	- Fixed a potential problem with deleting a selected object between the MOUSE_DOWN and MOUSE_UP selection events.
1.861:
	- Added a check to make sure the targetObject is in the display list before allowing it to be deleted to avoid runtime errors if it isn't.
	- Updated the event metadata in FlexTransformManager
1.86:
	- Fixed bug in destroy() method
1.85:
	- Fixed bug that could cause keyboard features (multi-select, delete, and arrows) to be lost on AIR pop-up windows after the 2nd launch
1.84:
	- Fixed bug that could cause lockScale not to prevent the scale cursor from appearing on rollOver of the handles.
1.83:
	- Fixed a bug that caused odd behavior when rotating multiple-item selections through code (not interactively), like myManager.rotateSelection(). 
1.82:
	- Added logic to the code that prevents the arrow keys from moving the selection if/when the stage.focus is a TextField (otherwise the text cursor and the selection would both move)
1.81:
	- Added targetCoordinateSpace parameter to getSelectionBounds() and getSelectionBoundsWithHandles()
1.8:
	- Fixed several bugs related to cursor management
1.79:
	- Fixed bug that could cause highlighted text in a selected TextField to be deleted if another object was selected and then the DELETE or BACKSPACE key was pressed.
1.78:
	- Fixed bug that could cause a TransformItem to violate its scale constraints when the mouse is dragged far enough in the opposite direction
	- Fixed bug that could cause an item to scale too much in a very particular scenario.
1.77:
	- Changed package name from "gs" to "com.greensock" in order to comply with industry standards
	- Fixed bug in moveSelectionDepthUp() and moveSelectionDepthDown()
1.76:
	- Fixed bug that could cause minScaleX/maxScaleX/minScaleY/maxScaleY to be ignored in a very specific scenario.
1.75:
	- If an item is selected that "hasSelectableText", pressing the arrow keys won't move the item even if arrowKeysMove is true.
1.74:
	- Added DOUBLE_CLICK event dispatching from TransformManager (when the user double-clicks on the selected item(s))
	- Prevented MOVE events from being dispatched if movement on both axis is 0. 
1.73:
	- Added "hideCenterHandle" property
	- Fixed bug that could cause problems when an item is the same width/height as the bounds and the lockScale and lockPosition properties are true
1.72:
	- Fixed bug that could cause incorrect scaling when an item was rotated exactly at 90 degrees or negative 90 degrees.
1.71:
	- Fixed bug that could cause the selection to adjust the wrong way vertically when the origin is outside the bounds
	- Prevented a redraw of the selection box/handles if/when only the selection box/handles are outside the bounds and the user clicked on a rotation handle
1.7:
	- Changed the way TransformManager and TransformItem dispatch events. Added FINISH_INTERACTIVE_MOVE, FINISH_INTERACTIVE_SCALE, and FINISH_INTERACTIVE_ROTATE events that work the way the old MOVE/SCALE/ROTATE events worked. Now the MOVE/SCALE/ROTATE events are dispatched continuously while the actions are being performed (when the mouse moves)
1.68:
	- Fixed error that could occur when there are multiple TransformManager instances and the user clicks from one to the other.
1.67:
	- Worked around a Flex bug that caused problems with transforming text-related objects immediately after adding them to TransformManager
1.66:
	- Fixed bug that could cause problems if the targetObject wasn't on the stage when its TransformItem was being instantiated.
1.65:
	- Fixed some minor issues related to deleting items with hasSelectableText=true.
	- When an item with hasSelectableText=true is part of a multi-selection, it can be deleted. If it is the only item selected, it cannot (this is intuitive because the user would likely want the DELETE key to affect the text, not delete the whole object)
1.64:	
	- Fixed bug in FlexTransformManager that could cause an ignoredObject to not be ignored.
1.63:
	- Prevented a situation where in a multi-window AIR app, the cursors could be missing on new windows
1.6:
	- Added a moveCursor that indicates when selected items are moveable.
1.56:
	- Added public getUnrotatedSelectionWidth() and getUnrotatedSelectionHeight() methods
1.55:
	- Added isSelected() method
1.54:
	- Added arrowKeysMove getter/setter
1.5:
	- Made the edges draggable (there is a 10-pixel wide area around the border that users can drag). This is particularly helpful with TextFields/TextAreas.
	- Eliminated the need for the TransformItemTF class. TransformItem now handles TextFields too (see the "hasSelectableText" and "scaleMode" additions below).
	- Added "hasSelectableText" property which sets the scaleMode to SCALE_WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT, and prevents dragging of the object unless clicking on the edges/border or center handle, and allows the delete key to be pressed without deleting the object itself.
	- Added "scaleMode" property which can be set to either TransformManager.SCALE_NORMAL (the default), or TransformManager.SCALE_WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT which is useful for text-related objects and/or components. Note: when the scaleMode is set to SCALE_WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT, you cannot flip the object backwards in either direction, nor can you scale it as part of a multi-selection.
	- Added scaleMode and hasSelectableText parameters to the addItem() and addItems() methods of TransformManager
	- Altered FlexTransformManager so that TextAreas, TextInputs, UITextFields, Labels, and RichTextEditors are automatically scaled using width/height instead of scaleX/scaleY in order to retain the size of the text.
	- Altered FlexTransformManager so that the focusThickness of selected components is set to zero (otherwise, it can interfere with the handles slightly)
	- Worked around a bug in the Flex framework that inaccurately reported width/height on some components intermittently, causing the selection box to be drawn incorrectly sometimes.
1.49:
	- Fixed bug that could cause it to get stuck in multi-select mode if the users holds down SHIFT, then clicks on another window, releases SHIFT, and clicks back on this window.
1.48:
	- Made changes in order to accommodate a scenario where the targetObject is deleted immediately upon selection (in a TransformEvent.SELECT listener) - previously a 1009 error would be thrown.
1.47:
	- Fixed bug that could occassionally cause movement of certain components to appear to "jitter" when hitting the bounds
1.46:
	- Fixed bug that could cause exceptions when selecting an object object that fills the entire width or height of the bounds you defined.
1.45:
	- Fixed bug that could occassionally cause items to be allowed to scale past the right-most bounds edge.
1.43:
	- Fixed bug that could occassionally cause incorrect scaling when an item is positioned exactly on top of the bottom right corner of the boundary and scaled with the upper left corner handle
	- Fixed bug that could occassionally cause the stretching handles (on the top, bottom, left and right) to not function if the object was positioned directly on top of a boundary/edge.
1.42:
	- Added width and height getters/setters to TransformItem and fixed minor bug in TransformItem's scale() method
1.41:
	- Fixed slight offset that can occur between the handle and the mouse when scaling
	- Fixed SHIFT-DRAG behavior that sometimes didn't honor the origin when skipping from x- to y- movement
	- Fixed boundary constraint behavior when interactively scaling so that it doesn't force the proportions to correlate with the mouse that's beyond the boundaries.
	- Added scaleX, scaleY, rotation, x, y, and alpha getters/setters to TransformItem. scaleX, scaleY, and rotation always use the center of the TransformItem as the registration point.
