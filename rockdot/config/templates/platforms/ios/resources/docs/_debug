Hi Nils,

To debug an application via command line.
You need to create apk-debug using new command line parameter -listen
Following are the steps

1.Execute following command to package an application.

adt -package -target apk-debug -listen 7936 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore Certificate.p12 -storepass Password OutputfileName.apk Inputfile-app.xml Inputfile.swf

2. Launch an application on the device after installing using command

adb -install OutputfileName.apk

After this step You need Fdb.jar to debug the application via command line.
You have to wait till flash builder new drop is available.
There is a link given in Release notes to join Flash builder prerelease .
Once Flash builder new drop is available you can use the flex sdk and then debugging can be done by doing following steps.

. Forward port on the Desktop using adb command

adb -d forward tcp:7936 tcp:7936


3. Launch fdb using command

fdb -p 7936

4. On executing above command fdb terminal will be open then execute

(fdb) file Outputfile.swf
(fdb) run

run command will throw following output

Player connected; session starting.
Set breakpoints and then type ’continue’ to resume the session.
[SWF] Outputfile.swf - 1,436,428 bytes after decompression

Now give name of function to debug

(fdb) break funtionname

following output will be shown

Breakpoint 1 created, but not yet resolved.
The breakpoint will be resolved when the corresponding file or function is loaded.

Now execute continue command to

(fdb)c

5. After this Debug session will be  establish . All you have to do is click the button on the application which will hit the function mention in break command



ANSWER 2

Please do the following steps:

1.      Package the application using -listen <port-number> with ADT.

2.      Install the application on the device.

3.      Launch the application on the device using: adt -launchApp -debuggerPort <port-number>  -appid <app-id>. Please specify the same port that was used during packaging of the application.

4.      You also need the latest fdb to use USB debugging feature and may get it from the Flex Hero pre-release or Flash Builder Burrito pre-release: https://prerelease.adobe.com/project/home.html?cap={B4DD6EBA-22D8-48AF-BD7E-0C95BD5EAE0C}<https://prerelease.adobe.com/project/home.html?cap=%7bB4DD6EBA-22D8-48AF-BD7E-0C95BD5EAE0C%7d>

5.      Launch fdb -p <port-number>.
